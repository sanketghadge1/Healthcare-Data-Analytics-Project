# Healthcare-Data-Analytics-Project
In this project, I analyzed healthcare data to uncover insights related to patient admissions, treatment outcomes, disease patterns, and hospital performance. Using tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python, I cleaned and visualized large datasets to identify trends in readmission rates, average length of stay, and treatment success rates.
